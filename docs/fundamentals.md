## Getting Started

 * Python comes with a built-in IDE called IDLE
 * Blocks are called suites
 * suites are preceded by :, a syntactical requirement of the language


# create an object that represents todays time
# then extract the value of the minute attribute
# then assign it to a variable `right_this_minute`
# right_now = datetime.today()
# right_this_minute = right_now.minute

* programmers like the shell to experiment first, then code
* for is your friend
* while is when you dont know how many times, for is when you do
* sleep is used to pause your program
* from import lets you import without qualification
* import requires qualification (dot notation)

## Immutability

Strings in Python are immutable. They cannot be changed.
In memory, Python has to remove from memory, and reassign.


## Functions and Methods

Python offers automatic tools we can use on strings.
## Commenting Your Code

# suites, not blocks of code and no curly brackets

# embedded suites are just blocks of indented code

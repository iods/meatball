Meatball
========

A multiple project repository and personal development kit in Python.

If I ever had a snake, his name would be meatball.


Getting Started
---------------

To get started, you need to just clone it, and read my code.

### Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iods/python-meatball
```

Depending on your OS:

```sh
make {linux, osx}
```

Once the installation is complete, use CTRL+SHIFT+V in the terminal window to
activate the virtual environment (`source venv/bin/activate` was copied during setup).


> Minimum Python version required is 3.6


Development
-----------

WIP.
